University project about Indexing and Information Retrieval

This project consists of two parts:
- Indexing a document corpus via inverted files in order to describe documents with all or a part of the elements contained in the corpus
- Convert a query written in natural language by a user in SQL to query a database. It will also be necessary through the morphological analyzer to create a spell checker to tolerate a few typos or spelling errors made ​​by the user. The syntactic analysis, in turn, can generate a grammar (here type 2) transforming a natural language query entered by the user query language SQL.
